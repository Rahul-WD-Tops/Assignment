    <ul>07.What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
        Session State</ul>
    <li>contains information that is pertaining to a specific session (by a particular client/browser/machine) with
        the
        server.
        It's a way to track what the user is doing on the site.. across multiple pages...amid the statelessness of
        the
        Web.
        e.g.
        the contents of a particular user's shopping cart is session data. Cookies can be used for session state.

        View State
        on the other hand is information specific to particular web page. It is stored in a hidden field so that it
        isn't
        visible to the user. It is used to maintain the user's illusion that the page remembers what he did on it
        the
        last
        time
        - dont give him a clean page every time he posts back. </li>

        While Loop

        Do While Loop</li>




    <ul>11.What is the function of the delete operator?</ul>
    <li>In JavaScript, the delete Operator’s main purpose is to remove a property from an object. In this article,
        we
        are
        going
        to learn about delete Operator in JavaScript.</li>


    <ul>12.What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</ul>
    <li>there are Three type of POPUP boxes in javaScript

        alert();
        Confirm();
        Prompt();</li>
    <ul>13.What is the use of Void (0)?</ul>
    <li>The void operator is often used merely to obtain the undefined primitive value, usually using “void(0)”
        (which
        is
        equivalent to “void 0”). In these cases, the global variable undefined can be used instead (assuming it has
        not
        been
        assigned to a non-default value).</li>

    <ul>14.How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</ul>
    <li> We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript.
    </li>


    <ul>15.What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</ul>
    <li>Inner HTML is slow because when we use the inner HTML property in the code it allows us to change using the
        JavaScript
        language. It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content
        again so
        that’s why it takes time.

        Event handlers attached to any DOM element are preserved When we have used the event handlers then the event
        handlers
        are not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML. To change that, we have to track
        the.
        event
        handlers and manually attach them to a new element. </li>





    <div class="pass">
        <p class="first" id="first"></p>
        <label for="">EnterPassword : </label>
        <input id="pass-id" class="inputs" oninput="dtu2()" type="password" placeholder="Password"
            onclick="handlevalidation()">
        <p id="show" onclick="show()">Show</p>
    </div>


    </div>

    <script>

        function handlevalidation() {
            document.getElementById("show").style.display = "block"

        }
        function show() {
            let userp = document.getElementById("pass-id")

            if (userp.type === "password") {
                userp.type = "text"
                document.getElementById("show").innerText = "hide"

            }
            else {
                userp.type = "password";
                document.getElementById("show").innerText = "show"
            }
        }
